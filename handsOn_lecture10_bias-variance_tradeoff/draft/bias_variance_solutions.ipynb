The second term is the **variance** of the estimator $\\hat{f}$ and the final term is the **bias** of the estimator. There is an inherent tradeoff between the bias and variance of an estimator. Generally, more complex estimators (think of high-degree polynomials as an example) will have a low bias since they will fit the sampled data really well. However, this accuracy will not be maintained if we continued to resample the data, which implies that the variance of this estimator is high.  "
